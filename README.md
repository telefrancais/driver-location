## Driver Location

This is a web application that displays the delivery stops that a truck driver needs to make for their current route. It shows the progress with the completed
route in green and the remaining route in red. Progress can be updated using a form to select the current leg of the route and the distance travelled on that route.

To run the web application, clone or unzip the repository into your directory of choice. In a command prompt window, head to that directory and run 'npm install' to
install all the dependencies. Use the command 'npm run dev' to run both the server and the browser window at the same time. The browser should open itself, but if it
doesn't, the app runs on 'http://localhost:3000'.
